This was created to practice my Javascript skills. It is a website that I created using Javascript to act as a homepage when I open a new tab or a browser. It uses Javascripts date functionality to show the current date and time. It accesses Accuweather's API to get the current conditions including temperature, weather text, and weather icon. It reads a JSON version of the top Reddit posts and displays them, along with the top New York Times articles, and the top CNN articles. The background is regularly updated by grabbing the top post from the popular "EarthPorn" subreddit. The top gainer and loser stocks are retreived using the IEX Cloud API and the graphs are made using the chart.js library.
